                    <p>“Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that require human-like intelligence,
                    such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making, and is being applied in various fields including healthcare,
                    finance, and transportation with the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives and transform industries.”
                    Indeed, you see this to be true right now, as that entire sentence was generated by OpenAI’s new model called ChatGPT,
                    which is capable of answering countless questions in a dialogue fashion.
                    </p>
                    <div class="subtitle">
                        What is it?
                    </div>
                    <p>In essence, Artificial Intelligence is a growing technology tasked with programming computers to mimic human
                    characteristics, including the ability to learn and problem solve. While many default to thinking of world-ending robots
                    in science fiction, AI is built through the implementation of math, computer science, linguistics, psychology, and
                    various other fields. For example, a simple AI program could be tasked with receiving a picture as input and learning
                    how to determine whether it best reflects a dog or cat. While the objective is seemingly easy for us humans, AI models
                    require extensive datasets and several hours of processing before it can produce somewhat accurate results.
                    </p>
                    <p>However, with enough data, processing power, and time, AI has several real-world applications, such as self-driving
                    cars, financial market analysis, and can even impact the healthcare industry. AI is slowly being used to dose drugs,
                    plan out viable treatments for certain patients, and assist in certain surgical procedures. For instance, PathAI is
                    developing a machine learning model which will assist pathologists when making cancer diagnosis, reducing errors and
                    improving patient treatment.

                    <p>Mentioned above, machine learning is one subset of artificial intelligence. Just like the name suggests, ML refers to
                    programming computers to learn from and adapt to new data without the assistance of humans. Machine learning is a very
                    popular approach to AI and is further explored through deep learning techniques, which involves exposing the computer to
                    massive amounts of data, such as text. ChatGPT was designed by incorporating both machine learning and deep learning
                    techniques, training the model to recognize text and generate accurate, human-like responses.
                    </p>
                    <p>AI can be classified into two categories: weak and strong, each with its own use case and technology. As can be
                    inferred, weak AI involves a model that can perform one specific task effectively. This category of AI is commonly
                    applied in video games, such as the chess AI bot Stockfish, and personal assistants like Alexa, Siri and Google
                    Assistant. In contrast, strong AI reflects models that perform human-like tasks that involve problem solving or decision
                    making. These models are commonly used for self-driving cars, medical operating rooms, and the like. When reflecting
                    back to ChatGPT, while it shares similarities to personal assistants and weak AI models, it produces a conversational
                    dialogue with its users, generating answers that humans ourselves can struggle to answer, making it a strong AI.
                    </p>

                        History of Artificial Intelligence
                    </div>
                    <p>
                    Unfortunately, there were several difficulties that would limit Turing’s pursuit, as computers were expensive and lacked
                    the ability to store information. While computers can be priced for a mere few hundred dollars in 2023 and are found in
                    the pockets of nearly every person, leasing a computer in the 1950s could be around $200,000 monthly. As a result,
                    gaining access to a computer was only possible for prestigious universities and large technology companies.
                    Nevertheless, even with access to such a computer, they would be incapable of storing any information, preventing Turing
                    from successfully creating an AI model that can learn from its previous decisions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Throughout the next few decades, technology experienced immense advancement and so did AI and machine learning. In
                    tandem with computers gaining memory, speed, and accessibility, various institutions and programs received funding to
                    research artificial intelligence. From DARPA funding MIT to the research of several scientists at IBM, AI’s growth was
                    drastic between 1980 and 1990 with the rise of expert systems, the Fifth Generation Computer Project, and AARON: an
                    autonomous drawing program.

                    A common theme that may have been deduced from AI’s history is the critical role computer performance plays in the
                    successful development of AI models and programs. Despite its undoubted growth, the core principles of AI have not
                    changed or improved, only the limits that computer speed and memory place on scientists. In contrast to the fixed
                    position Turing battled in the 1950s, Moore’s Law has enabled society to improve ML models and create notable
                    applications. While some theorize the law will soon come to an end, it states that the memory and speed of computers
                    will double every year, a fact that has been true for over ten years.
                    </p>

                    With this exponential advancement in computing
                    power, there is a direct correlation with AI applications and programs, varying from self-driving cars and models like
                    ChatGPT. When reflecting on the history of AI, the most notable AI program that shaked the field and exemplified the
                    sheer potential it has in modernizing our world was Deep Blue. Defeating the World Champion of chess, Garry Kasparov,
                    Deep Blue demonstrated how effective computers can absorb information and produce extremely precise results as output.

                        While it is evident that Artificial Intelligence is and has the potential to significantly improve human life, it could
                        also be incredibly dangerous, not only disrupting the global economy but also becoming our civilisation’s largest
                        existential threat. In fact, many innovative and leading CEOs in Silicon Valley have shared their fears of AI and their
                        concern for the future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2015, Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, said, “First the machine will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super
                        intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well. A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong
                        enough to be a concern.” In the present year of 2023, the economy is already experiencing a shift in autonomy and AI, as
                        large factories are implementing more autonomous robots. For instance, Amazon Warehouses are almost entirely autonomous,
                        with numerous different robotic systems working together to read, package, label, and sort products. Currently, our
                        global economy has yet to experience a large crash, but imagine the impact AI could have if all fast-food restaurant
                        chains were fully autonomous.

                            travel.
                        </div>

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        According to a 2014 article by The Guardian, Elon Musk expressed the importance of both national and international
                        regulations on Artificial Intelligence, stating, “I think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence. If I
                        had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is, it’s probably that.” The founder and CEO of many technological
                        revolutionary companies, it seems Elon Musk is most concerned about the political dangers AI can erupt. If you reflect
                        back in history, specifically the Cold War, nations were in a race to compete for the most powerful nuclear weapon,
                        oblivious to the sheer overwhelming power and devastation they could cause. Similarly, it is possible that artificially
                        intelligent models and programs could become the modern nuclear weapon if we underestimate its power and potential.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An in interview with BBC, Stephen Hawking also shared his concerns for Artificial Intelligence, warning us that “The
                        development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race. It would take off on its own, and
                        re-design itself at an ever-increasing rate”. The brilliant theoretical physicist explained how computers are growing
                        exponentially, allowing AI to reach a point where it could replicate and improve itself over and over again. Compared to
                        the limited biological evolution humans have endured for thousands of years, AI could easily become more intelligent and
                        gain power over us.

                    <p>
                    After deeply exploring the potential of artificial intelligence, including the positive and negative benefits it can
                    bring to society, I believe it is a brilliant tool that is worth learning with appropriate safety precautions. Although
                    it has several frightening risks, such as disrupting the global economy and sparking political conflicts, human
                    curiosity makes AI development and research inevitable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Rather than attempting to limit its growth, it is most effective
                    to place secure guidelines and regulations that ensure AI can never reach a point where it can harm civilization and
                    become unmanageable. Similar to Elon Musk’s conclusion, AI has the potential to become the next nuclear weapon, and

                    That being said, AI is an amazing technological advancement to explore, and there are numerous resources online that
                    help teach people how they are created. For example, by following Harvard’s CS50 AI online course, I was able to create
                    a powerful tic-tac-toe AI bot that can never lose. While its speed of performance is not optimized, the bot is a
                    beautiful example of how it can be powerful for even high school students. From creating game bots to designing programs
                    that direct drivers to empty parking lots, the possibilities of beneficial AI are endless.
